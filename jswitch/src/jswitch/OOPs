OOPS -> Object Oriented Programing

Everything is object and each object has -> Properties and behaviour
Example ->Dog has property as it has height,nose,tongue and it has behaviour as it barks on strnager

Object is created with the help of class and created by jvm when we compile the code and code get converted into the byte code

------Method overloading------
Method overloading depends on the parameter, its order and number of parameter.
It doesnot depends on the return type of the method.
It is also an example of the run time polymorphism as compiler at the run time determines which method to call based on the parameter
